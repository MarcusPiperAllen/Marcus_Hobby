      <h2>Strategic Partner for Digital Excellence</h2>
      <p>I'm Marcus, a web developer who transforms complex ideas into premium digital solutions. I partner with
        leaders, educators, and entrepreneurs who need more than a template—they need a strategic collaborator who
        understands their vision and delivers results that matter.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- What I Focus On -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>What I Deliver</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Strategic clarity from scattered content.</strong> I organize your message, structure your pages, and
          create a digital presence that commands authority and builds trust.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Custom solutions, not templates.</strong> Every project is built specifically for your needs, your
          audience, and your business goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Responsive, accessible design.</strong> Your site works flawlessly across all devices and meets modern
          accessibility standards.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Measurable results.</strong> I focus on outcomes that support your business—whether that's
          credibility, conversions, or client engagement.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Long-term partnership.</strong> I build sites that are easy to maintain, update, and scale as your
          business grows.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- How I Work -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>My Process</h2>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>Discovery:</strong> Every project starts with understanding your goals, your audience, and what
          success looks like for your business. I gather your content and identify what matters most.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Strategy:</strong> I develop a clear structure—pages, navigation, messaging hierarchy. What's the most
          important message? What do visitors need to find immediately? What supports your business objectives?
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Execution:</strong> I design and build your site with attention to detail, focusing on clarity,
          performance, and user experience. Every decision is intentional and aligned with your goals.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Delivery:</strong> You receive a professional, fully-functional website that clearly communicates who
          you are, what you do, and how to work with you—without feeling like a generic template.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </section>

    <!-- A Human Note -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Why Work With Me</h2>
      <p>I bring a strategic mindset to every project. I don't just build websites—I create digital solutions that
        support your business goals. You get a partner who values clarity, precision, and results. If you're looking for
        someone who delivers professional work with attention to detail and a focus on what actually matters, we'll work
        well together.</p>
