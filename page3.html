      <h2>Who I Am</h2>
      <p>I'm Marcus, a web developer who likes working with people who have something real to share — a practice, a
        business, a mission — but don't have the time or energy to wrestle with their website. I help turn scattered
        notes, links, and ideas into a site that feels solid and easy to navigate.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- What I Focus On -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>What I Focus On</h2>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Turning messy content into clear pages.</strong> Most people have the content — they just need help
          organizing it into a structure that makes sense.</li>
        <li><strong>Showing before/after improvements.</strong> I believe in demonstrating transformation visually so
          clients can see the value.</li>
        <li><strong>Building simple tools that solve specific problems.</strong> Whether it's a quiz app, an SMS alert
          system, or a content organizer, I focus on practical solutions.</li>
        <li><strong>Working iteratively with clients.</strong> I keep people in the loop, break projects into manageable
          steps, and make sure the site matches how they actually work.</li>
        <li><strong>Long-term maintainability.</strong> I build sites that are easy to update and expand as needs grow.
        </li>
      </ul>

    <!-- How I Work -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>How I Work</h2>
      <p>Every project starts with listening. I gather your content, understand your goals, and figure out what your
        visitors actually need to see.</p>
      <p>Then I move into structure: pages, navigation, and priorities. What's the most important message? What do
        people need to find quickly? What can wait?</p>
      <p>From there, I design and implement the site with a focus on clarity and long-term maintainability. I use AI
        tools to help with structure and speed, but every decision, layout, and final line of code is reviewed and owned
        by me.</p>
      <p>The result is a site that clearly explains who you are, what you do, and how to work with you — without feeling
        like a generic template or an overwhelming project.</p>
    </section>

    <!-- A Human Note -->
    <section class="about-section">
      <h2>Beyond the Screen</h2>
      <p>Outside of work, I care a lot about health, family, and long-term projects. That mindset shows up in my
        development work — I'd rather build something steady and maintainable than chase quick hacks. I stay curious,
        follow good teachers, and use solid tools. If you're looking for someone who values clarity, structure, and real
        results, we'll probably work well together.</p>
